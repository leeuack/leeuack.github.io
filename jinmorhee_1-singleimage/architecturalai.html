        <p class="blog-content">This is a book about architectural design and artificial intelligence technology in korean. The book provides opportunity to imagine how artificial intelligence technology and architectural design can meet and be integrated through several experiments. Prior to the experiments, this book look back at how computers and artificial intelligence technology were introduced into architectural design and how the artificial intelligence technology that we know today has started and developed with designers. Based on this, this book examines actual experiments in which artificial intelligence technology is applied in urban and architectural scales. Each experiment reveals that AI technology can serve as a supportive tool and passive companion to help designers, not clich√©s who threaten the future of humanity seen in Hollywood movies, explore broader and deeper solutions.<br>
This book is intended to briefly explain technical terms and architectural concepts for the general public and architects who have no background in artificial intelligence. Rather than introducing difficult mathematical concepts, the book introduces the fusion of artificial intelligence technology and architectural design from a humanities and social perspective.
