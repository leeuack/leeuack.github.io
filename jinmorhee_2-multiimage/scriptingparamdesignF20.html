<p class="blog-content2">This course aims to prepare students to modeling geometry through scripted development of parametric schemes for architecture applications — that is, to introduce students to basic scripting with a focus on algorithms relating to form making and to reinforce and extend basic concepts of parametric modeling.</p>

<p class="blog-content2"> <i>“Parameters express architectural values in rational, functional and objective terms. As the evolution of the chosen parameters is traced over time, the project emerges as of its own accords.”
<br>Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, UNStudio </i> </p>

<p class="blog-content2">Contemporary approaches to modeling architectural geometry are computational — this is reflected in designers wanting much more control over the genera¬tive process by varying the parameters; in turn, this enhances the efficiency with which they can navigate design varia¬tions, analyze design artifacts and explore design manifestation. The complexity of constructing geometry sometimes can be simplified as sequences of machining instruc¬tions, which allow geometry to be built by designated fabricating techniques and materials.  In other words, designers not only generate the conceptual ideas but also design the fabrication process.</p>

<p class="blog-content2">Computing and fabricating non-simple and sometimes intricate geometric forms that go beyond straight¬forward modeling exercise. In order to realize the goals set forth above, this course has two parts:  firstly, to supply the basics of object-oriented programming (using Python), and secondly, to supply the basics of scripting parametric geometric constructions (using GH Python in conjunction with Rhino/Grasshopper objects).
<br>Students are expected to be familiar with the basics of parametric modeling – i.e., Rhino/Grasshopper, since the course is an intermediate course to bridge advanced parametric design to the generative design system in the frame of computational design. Through this course, students can start to pragmatically expand their basic knowledge in the parametric design into the generative design.</p>

<p class="blog-content2">The course consists of lectures, computer instruction and assignments. 
<br>In the first part of the course, students   will use Jupyter Notebook. The second part of the course focuses on generative geometry construction — customizing procedures for generative design via scripting and/or the use of specific plug-ins. The primary graphical scripting construct is the Grasshopper Python component, which take inputs and produces graphical output, for purposes of display, modeling or making.
