	  <intitle>Classifying Building Form Using Deep Learning</intitle>
	  <img src="news_imgs/epb_journal_building_form.jpeg" width="100%" >  
      The paper "An inductive method for classifying building form in a city with implications for orientation" is published. This paper explores the role of deep learning in analyzing building forms. Central to this study is the debate on whether the orientation of buildings, shaped by a city's unique environmental, social, and cultural contexts, should influence architectural classifications. Employing a detailed dataset and a case study from Montreal, the research examines buildings with varying orientations to understand how these aspects reflect and define urban identity. This work not only advances building form analysis but also encourages a reimagined understanding of our cities' architectural landscapes.

	  <intitle>Design Automation of Refugee Camp Layout is Initiated</intitle>
      Vice President of Research (VPR) Catalyst Grant is awarded to initiate the research projecte titled "An Automated Deployable Camp Layout Technology for Rapid, Efficient, and Safer Refugee Settlement Design.". This research addresses swifter, more effective responses to displacement in the urgent global refugee crisis, characterized by both traditional geopolitical factors and emerging environmental causes. Acknowledging the transnational nature of this challenge, the study proposes an innovative AI-driven design automation technology to expedite the creation of well-organized refugee camp layouts, ensuring immediate and provisional settlements that foster both safety and integration. This endeavor holds potential for broader applications beyond refugee contexts, including military and industrial facility layout design. By significantly reducing design time, enhancing construction efficiency, and accommodating diverse needs, this research contributes to the innovation of more secure, efficient, and sustainable solutions in refugee settlement design and beyond.<date>03.Dec.2023</date>

	  <intitle>Neural Networks in Computer-Aided Architectural Design Over Three Decades</intitle>
	  <img src="news_imgs/design_science_journal_three_decades.jpeg" width="100%" >
	  A recently published article in the Design Science Journal dives deep into the computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) and its intersection with machine learning, specifically neural networks. The study, titled "Three decades of machine learning with neural networks in computer-aided architectural design (1990–2021)", offers a systematic review of publications in this domain, highlighting trends, historical contexts, and future challenges. A significant takeaway from this research is the call for increased transparency in CAAD studies using deep learning. The author underscores the importance of reproducibility, emphasizing the need to share datasets, training experiments, and other critical information. Interested readers are encouraged to delve into the full article for a detailed exploration and guidelines aimed at improving the quality of CAAD research with machine learning.

      <intitle>Form Data as a Resource in Architectural Analysis</intitle>
	  <img src="news_imgs/digital_creativity_mhasey.jpeg" width="100%" >
	  A scholarly article has been recently published in the prestigious Digital Creativity journal by Routledge, detailing research on architectural forms utilizing artificial intelligence, which contributed to constructing a typology for the Carpetian Wood Church, a valuable architectural type with local and historical significance. The author of this article is my esteemed advisee, Michael Hasey, whose master's thesis was researched and taught under my guidance at the Computational Design Laboratory with Daniel Cardoso Llach, the lab director. This study demonstrates a pioneering approach to how data science-based architectural form research can play a significant role in the preservation of endangered architecture.

      <intitle>Urban Form Analysis through Morphometry and Machine Learning</intitle>
	  <img src="news_imgs/AI_in_urban.jpg" width="100%" >
	  Jinmo Rhee's new chapter titled "Urban form Analysis through Morphometry and Machine Learning" was published in the book "Artificial Intelligence in Urban Planning and Design". This chapter introduces the concept of morphometry, which is a subbranch in form studies in biology and has already actively employed AI technology, i.e., machine learning techniques, in the context of architectural and urban form analysis. The introduction is centered on how this concept as a distinct approach to form studies that can help trace latent granular patterns of urban types and fabrics and thereby change the understanding of city space. By presenting a research example of urban form analysis and synthesis using the concept and methods from morphometry, this chapter demonstrates the process of constructing urban form dataset, extracting features from the dataset, identifying urban types based on the extracted features, and evaluating the results of categorization. Based on this example, this chapter opens the potential that urban form analysis can be expanded into more complex dimensional studies by integrating formal and nonformal information due to the use of AI technologies.

This work proposes a new data format, treating the city as a set of individual urban spaces rather than dividing them by existing boundaries.His video presents an innovative approach to urban analysis, one that moves beyond traditional maps and diagrams to capture the full complexity of the built environment. By treating the city as a collection of individual spaces, Rhee is able to uncover hidden patterns and connections that might be missed by more traditional methods. This approach has the potential to transform our understanding of urban environments, allowing us to see them in new and more nuanced ways.<date>15.Aug.2021</date>
		
      <intitle>DEEPRISE, the Grand Prize from Digital Architecture 2021</intitle>
	  <img src="news_imgs/deeprise_awarded.jpg" width="100%" >
	  One of Jinmo's recent project, DEEPRISE, won the international competition to Digital Architecture (DA 2021) hosted by Architectural Institute of Korea (AIK) and Korea Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. DEEPRISE is the prototype of massing a high-rise building form using a deep learning (DL) model. The research team collected data comprehending diverse forms of high-rise building from major cities in the world to train a generative DL model (IntroVAE) to capture morphological features. After clustering the features, they can distinguish types of high-rise buildings and use that information to generate novel high-rise building forms. This research demonstrates that generative DL models can uncover the latent types of architectural form in large datasets and can expand the typological interpretation of complex architectural forms. Besides, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed DL method for building massing design by developing a proposal of a high-rise building form based on three techniques: exploration, synthesis, and interpolation.

      <cite>In Pursuit of Deep Architectural Design, Rumoer #76</cite>
	  <img src="news_imgs/rumoer.jpg" width="100%" >
	  Jinmo Rhee and his colleague write a chapter about deep learning and design for a design magazine, Rumoer. In this article they will focus on a branch of the work of CRAIDL that addresses generative design in the context of architectural configuration. Generative design is an indirect method of design where the designer employs models that embed some form of decision-making, such as instructions or behaviors, to generate design alternatives. With the current technology, this generation typically relies on a parametric structure, rules, or other mechanisms that are explicitly defined by the designer. However, designers do not always have access to the rationale necessary to create certain types of design. Not surprisingly, designers conventionally rely on their experience and intuition to generate good design solutions instead of looking for explicit design logic. This is where Deep Learning comes into play. DL is the field of AI concerned with using some experience, such as data or simulation, to make a certain model (usually neural networks with multiple layers) learn a specific task. In the case of generative design, they are interested in training neural networks to incorporate an alien or implicit design rationale into our design process. Architectural design is a complex activity that addresses wicked problems, so they consider it fundamental to explore the relationships among different design aspects that can benefit from DL. In this paper, they will introduce two projects that tackle distinct facets of design: An Academy of Spatial Agents and Deeprise.

	  Jinmo Rhee’s MSCD thesis “Context-rich Urban Analysis and Generation Using Artificial Intelligence: A Case Study in Pittsburgh, PA” was selected by the Korean Institute of Architects (KIA) for the special exhibition “Korean Student in the United States Special Exhibition 2019” in KIA Convection and Exhibition 2019 after winning a juried competition. With a focus on Pittsburgh’s urban fabric, Rhee’s MSCD thesis explores how computational methods may enable a new approach to analyzing a city’s morphology. In developing his thesis, Rhee worked with Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture professors Daniel Cardoso Llach, Ramesh Krishnamurti, Daragh Byrne, and Eddy Man Kim, and School of Design professor Molly Wright Steenson. His work reports on the analytical potential of machine learning methods for urban analysis. It documents a new method for data-driven urban analysis based on diagrammatic images describing each building in a city in relation to its immediate urban context. By statistically analyzing architectural and contextual features in this new dataset, the method can identify clusters of similar urban conditions and produce a detailed picture of a city’s morphological structure. Remapping the clusters from data to 2D space, our method enables a new kind of urban plan that displays gradients of urban similarity. Taking Pittsburgh as a case study we demonstrate this method, and propose “morphological types” as a new category of urban analysis describing a given city’s specific set of distinct morphological conditions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this method and its limitations, as well as its potentials for architecture, urban studies, and computation.
